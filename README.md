# Chrome HDMI for Channels (CH4C)

This project merges elements of the excellent [Chrome Capture for Channels](https://github.com/fancybits/chrome-capture-for-channels) and [HDMI for Channels](https://github.com/tmm1/androidhdmi-for-channels) projects, in an attempt to capture benefits of each. It builds on the original idea from [ParksideParade](https://github.com/ParksideParade/CH4C).

**Why I made this:**

- Recovering channels lost from TV Everywhere
- Recording web-only content (e.g., high school sports streaming websites without apps)
- Running on a low-cost PC (including Celeron-based machines running Channels DVR) with a relatively inexpensive external HDMI encoder like the Link Pi ENC1-V3 (~$120)

## Requirements

### Hardware

- **Windows PC or Mac**: Most Windows PCs work well. macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon via Rosetta 2) is also supported. I run both Channels DVR and CH4C together on the same low-power Intel Celeron 5105 PC.
- **Encoder**: Recommended [Link Pi ENC1-v3](https://a.co/d/76zJF9U) with dual input ports (HDMI and USB). For the USB port, use an HDMI to USB adapter.
- **VNC Server** (for remote browser access):
  - **Windows**: Install [TightVNC](https://www.tightvnc.com/) and enable **loopback connections** so CH4C's built-in VNC viewer can connect locally.
  - **macOS**: Enable Screen Sharing in System Settings → General → Sharing. CH4C's built-in VNC viewer can connect to it at `127.0.0.1:5900`.

### Encoder Configuration

Follow the guidelines in the [Channels community thread](https://community.getchannels.com/t/linkpi-encoder-family/38860/4) to configure the encoders:

1. Connect your HDMI port(s) to the external encoder box
2. Set the encoder to 60fps or 30fps 1920x1080 (to match the streaming services), and test CBR/VBR/AVBR and bitrate (minimum 8,000 recommended) to your preference.  The secondary USB 2.0 LinkPi ENC1-v3 input only supports 30fps so set your encoder appropriately.
3. Set your display(s) to 1920x1080 @ 60Hz.  (Optionally on PC, in Intel Graphics Command Center, set Quantization Range to "Full" for better black levels)

See [example LinkPi encoder settings](./assets/linkpi-encoder-settings.jpg) for a recommended configuration.

## Installation

### Windows

Download `ch4c.exe` from the latest [release](https://github.com/dravenst/CH4C/releases).

### macOS

Download `ch4c` from the latest [release](https://github.com/dravenst/CH4C/releases), or install via npm:

```bash
npm install -g github:dravenst/CH4C
```

To update to the latest, run the same command again. For a specific stable release, check the [releases page](https://github.com/dravenst/CH4C/releases) for the latest tag:

```bash
npm install -g github:dravenst/CH4C#v0.4.3
```

On first run of the downloaded binary, remove the macOS quarantine flag:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ch4c
chmod +x ch4c
./ch4c --help
```

### Running from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dravenst/CH4C
cd CH4C
npm install
node main.js --help
```

### Running CH4C at Startup

Install CH4C as a service that starts automatically:

```bash
ch4c service install          # or: node main.js service install if running from source
```

**Windows** — registers a real Windows service (visible in `services.msc`) using the [WinSW](https://github.com/winsw/winsw) wrapper, which is downloaded automatically on first install. The service runs as `LocalSystem`; its job is to launch CH4C inside your logged-in desktop session with a normal (non-elevated) token, so Chrome and audio devices behave exactly as they do during a manual launch — a service cannot run Chrome itself. No account or password is needed. CH4C starts whenever a user is logged in and restarts automatically if it exits. Requires **Administrator privileges**:
```powershell
powershell -Command "Start-Process cmd -ArgumentList '/k cd /d C:\path\to\CH4C && ch4c service install' -Verb RunAs"
```

**macOS** — installs a launchd agent at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ch4c.plist`. No elevated privileges required:
```bash
ch4c service install
ch4c service install -d ~/ch4c-data   # custom data directory
```

**Other service commands** (Windows and macOS):

```bash
ch4c service status      # Check if installed and running
ch4c service start       # Start CH4C
ch4c service stop        # Stop CH4C gracefully
ch4c service uninstall   # Remove the service
```

> **Default data directory locations:**
> - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\ch4c` (e.g. `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\ch4c`). If a `data` folder exists in the CH4C install directory it will be used instead for backward compatibility.
> - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/ch4c`
>
> A log message at startup will confirm which location is in use. Use `-d <path>` to specify a custom directory.

For manual startup configurations using PowerShell scripts or batch files, see [ADVANCED_CONFIG.md](ADVANCED_CONFIG.md).

## Getting Started

> **Important**: On Windows, do NOT run ch4c.exe or display/sound config-related commands in a Remote Desktop session. Video and audio sources will change when using Remote Desktop. Use VNC instead (e.g., [TightVNC](https://www.tightvnc.com/)). See [Remote Access](#remote-access) for the built-in VNC viewer. On macOS, use Terminal or enable Screen Sharing for remote access.

CH4C is configured through its built-in **Settings** web interface. The home page includes a step-by-step Getting Started guide. Here is an overview of the setup process:

### Step 1: Preparation

Before starting CH4C:

1. Connect your HDMI encoder(s) to the computer
2. Set display(s) to **1920x1080** and configure the encoder transport stream to match (recommended **30fps**)
3. **Windows**: Install a VNC server (e.g., [TightVNC](https://www.tightvnc.com/)) and enable **loopback connections** for remote browser access
   **macOS**: Enable Screen Sharing in System Settings → General → Sharing for remote browser access

### Step 2: Configure Settings

Launch CH4C and navigate to `http://<CH4C_IP>:2442/settings`:

1. Enter your **Channels DVR URL** (e.g., `http://192.168.50.50`)
2. Optionally configure the **HTTPS port** for secure remote access (a self-signed SSL certificate is auto-generated, see [HTTPS_SETUP.md](HTTPS_SETUP.md))
3. Click **Save Settings**

![Settings - Server Configuration](./assets/settings-server.jpg)

### Step 3: Add Encoder(s)

In Settings, click **+ Add Encoder** for each HDMI encoder:

1. Set the **Encoder URL** (e.g., `http://192.168.50.71/live/stream0`)
2. Select the **Audio Device** from the dropdown — CH4C automatically discovers available audio devices and presents them for selection. Choose "Default" to use the system default audio device. If your device doesn't appear, select **Other (manual entry)...** to type a partial device name manually (e.g., "Encoder" or "MACROSILICON").

   > **Note**: On **Windows**, for the most complete audio device listing, install the `AudioDeviceCmdlets` PowerShell module. Run this once in an **Administrator PowerShell**: `Install-Module -Name AudioDeviceCmdlets -Force`. CH4C falls back to registry and WMI-based detection if the module is unavailable. On **macOS**, audio devices are detected automatically via `system_profiler`.
3. For multi-monitor setups, set the **Screen X/Y Position** — use the **Screens** button to visually select a display, or the home page shows a Display Configuration visual with offsets for each monitor. Display scale must be set to 100% for correct positioning.
4. Click **Add Encoder**, then **Save Settings** and restart CH4C

| Add Encoder Form | Select Screen |
|:------------------:|:--------------:|
| ![Settings - Add Encoder](./assets/settings-add-encoder.jpg) | ![Encoder - Select Screen](./assets/encoder-select-screen.jpg) |

### Step 4: Add M3U Source to Channels DVR

1. In Channels DVR, go to Settings → Add Source → Custom Channels
2. Set Stream Format to **MPEG-TS**
3. Enter the M3U URL: `http://<CH4C_IP>:2442/m3u-manager/playlist.m3u`

![Custom Channel in Channels DVR](./assets/customchannelm3umgr.jpg)

### Step 5: Test the Encoder

1. Verify your encoder appears on the CH4C home page in the **Encoder Status** section with a healthy status
2. Try tuning to the encoder's channel in Channels DVR to confirm video and audio are working

### Step 6: Log In to Streaming Services

Use the **Login Manager** on the home page (`http://<CH4C_IP>:2442/`) to automatically log in to supported streaming services across all running encoder browsers at once. Select a service, enter credentials, and CH4C logs in to each encoder browser sequentially — skipping any that are already logged in.  For services such as Sling TV, saved credentials will be used to trigger an automatic re-login if logout detected when streaming.

For services not listed in the Login Manager, use [Remote Access](#remote-access) (`http://<CH4C_IP>:2442/remote-access`) to log in manually via VNC. Credentials are cached per encoder in the browser profile but services may periodically require re-authentication.

![Remote Access VNC Viewer](./assets/remoteaccess.jpg)

### Step 7: Add Channels

Use the [M3U Manager](#m3u-manager) (`http://<CH4C_IP>:2442/m3u-manager`) to build your channel lineup:

- **Refresh Sling TV** to automatically sync channels from the Sling TV guide
- **Refresh DirecTV Stream** to automatically sync the full DirecTV Stream channel lineup (~500+ channels)
- **Add Custom Channel** for any streaming service URL (see [Sample Channel URLs](#sample-custom-channel-urls) below)

After adding channels, use the **M3U Refresh** section on the M3U Manager page to trigger Channels DVR to reload the playlist — select your M3U source from the dropdown and click **Refresh M3U**.

**Add Custom Channel for any streaming service and look up the Station ID:**

| Add Custom Channel in M3U Manager | Station Lookup Option |
|:------------------:|:--------------:|
| ![Add Custom Channel](./assets/addcustomchannel.jpg) | ![Station Lookup](./assets/stationlookup.jpg) |

**Use the Networks tab to quickly add popular channels** You can also add any custom channel URL using the Add Custom Channel button.

![Networks Tab](./assets/m3unetworks.jpg)

See [samples.m3u](./assets/samples.m3u) for additional examples including Sling TV, NBC.com, Spectrum, and Peacock ([Peacock link format](https://community.getchannels.com/t/adbtuner-a-channel-tuning-application-for-networked-google-tv-android-tv-devices/36822/1895)).

**Closed Captions in M3U URLs**: For Sling TV and custom channels that support closed captions, append `&cc=English` or `&cc=Off` to the stream URL. Sling TV channels can also be configured via the Edit Channel dialog in the M3U Manager. If no `cc` parameter is provided, CH4C leaves the service's closed caption state unchanged (Default behavior).

```
http://<CH4C_IP>:2442/stream?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwatch.sling.com%2F1%2Fchannel%2F...%2Fwatch&cc=English
http://<CH4C_IP>:2442/stream?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fwatch%2F...&cc=English
```

**Create a new Custom Channel in Channels DVR using the playlist.m3u URL found in your M3U Manager main screen:**

![Custom Channel in Channels DVR](./assets/customchannelm3umgr.jpg)

### Instant Recording

Navigate to `http://<CH4C_IP>:<CH4C_PORT>/instant` to:
- Instantly start recording any URL and it will automatically try to enable full screen video
- Tune your encoder to a URL without recording (watch in Channels on the encoder's channel number)
- **Record Later**: schedule a recording for a future date and time. Click **🕐 Record Later**, pick a date/time, and click **📅 Schedule Recording**. Scheduled recordings survive a CH4C restart and are listed on both the Instant Recording page and the home page. Cancel any scheduled recording from either page.
- Add your own show metadata that will be visible in the Channels DVR Recordings
- **Show Search**: automatically look up a specific episode or movie from a supported streaming service and pre-fill all recording metadata (title, episode, duration, artwork, and direct watch URL)
- **Closed Captions**: select Default, English, or Off from the CC dropdown. Default leaves the service's caption state unchanged. English or Off will open the player's subtitle menu and apply the selection after playback starts. If the CC menu is unavailable at startup (e.g., during pre-roll ads), CH4C retries in the background for up to 3 minutes. Supported on Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, Max (HBO Max), Sling TV, ESPN, Apple TV+, and YouTube.

Enter the show name and optionally an episode in the Show Search field, select a service, and click **Search**. The matching episode or movie details will be populated automatically — just select an encoder and start the recording.

### Remote Access

CH4C includes a built-in VNC viewer at `http://<CH4C_IP>:<CH4C_PORT>/remote-access` to connect to a VNC server running on your CH4C machine. This is used for logging in to streaming services in the encoder browsers.

For better clipboard functionality and security, enable HTTPS in [Settings](#settings). See [HTTPS_SETUP.md](HTTPS_SETUP.md) and [REMOTE_ACCESS_SETUP.md](REMOTE_ACCESS_SETUP.md) for details.

## Performance Notes

This works surprisingly well, though streaming providers may have occasional glitches that prevent consistent loading.

**Additional notes:**
- **macOS**: Supported on Intel and Apple Silicon (via Rosetta 2). Audio device detection, display detection, service installation, and fullscreen streaming are all supported. Linux support is not currently implemented.
- **Display Scale**: Display scale must be set to **100%** for correct window positioning on both Windows and macOS.
- **HLS Support**: The examples use MPEG-TS, but HLS is also supported. Configure your encoder for HLS, update the Channels custom channel to use HLS, and adjust the encoder parameter to use the HLS stream URL
- **Secondary Channels DVR Server**: Channels allows you to export an M3U playlist from your primary Channels DVR server and import it into a secondary server to allow remote access for a second Channels DVR instance (e.g. if you only want to run a single CH4C instance and share with another device.). See the [Channels DVR Export Channels](https://getchannels.com/docs/channels-dvr-server/how-to/export-channels/) documentation for details on how to export and customize the M3U parameters. I highly recommend using Tailscale to create a private network to provide connectivity between your Channels DVR servers.

  Example M3U URL with customization parameters entered in Secondary Channels DVR as a new [Custom Channel](https://getchannels.com/docs/channels-dvr-server/how-to/custom-channels/) M3U Source:
  ```
  http://<TAILSCALE-CHANNELSDVR-IP>:8089/devices/<SOURCENAME>/channels.m3u?format=hls&bitrate=5000&codec=h264&acodec=copy
  ```
  Be sure to also setup the XMLTV Guide Data field too:
  ```
  http://<TAILSCALE-CHANNELSDVR-IP>:8089/devices/<SOURCENAME>/guide/xmltv?duration=1209600
  ```
